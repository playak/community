# Top Crypto Prices

This app shows the latest prices (USD) and changes for the top 10 cryptocurrencies. 

It is a very simple app, but does exactly what I needed for myself, and why I bought the Tidbyt in the first place. Since there was no app that could do what I had hoped for, I wrote one myself.

Prices are updated through the free [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) API at a maximum rate of once per minute. This fits well within their [Free API Plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing). No API key required.

The gif animation shows a full animation loop, but looks kind of ugly compared to the PNG image above, which shows what the fonts look like on the Tidbyt.
